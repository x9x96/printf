# Project Printf
A team project by [Victoria Iria](https://github.com/EseVic) and I [@ALX SE](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering/)...

## Description
```_printf()``` is a build to replicate the functionality of the C programming function ```printf()```. 
It returns the entirety of characters printed to the stdout "**the standard output stream**" (excluding the null byte at the end of strings) after a successful execution....

###
This function write its output to the stdout "**the standard output**".\
The available specified convertions are:
+ %c: Prints a single character.
+ %s: Prints a string of characters.
+ %d: prints integers
+ %i: also prints integers
+ %b: prints the binary representation of an unsigned decimal
+ %u: prints unsigned integers
+ %x: prints the hexadecial representation of an unsigned decimal in lowercase
+ %X:prints the hexadecial representation of an unsigned decimal in uppercase letters

## Usage
+ All the files are to be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
+ Include the "main.h" header file on the functions using the _printf()

## Indemnification
Attempts**s** were made to replicate the functionality of ```printf()``` but did not satisfy the requirement of some testcases.\
We admit ```_printf()``` custom build utilized in this project was traced to it's first occurance

## Attribution
High regards to **Enrico** for the [solution](https://github.com/Joshua-Enrico/printf) to this project as we were able to put more time into understanding the functionality of ```_printf()```
